  |   Calling all pilots: Earth is under alien attack! Your assistance is   |
  |   required! No experience necessary.                                    |

  |   Piloting an advanced star fighter with just one button is simple:     |
  |   you switch, you shoot. Every shot fired changes your direction, and   |
  |   mastering this is the key to becoming a legend among the stars.       |
  |   Timing is everything!                                                 |

  |   Don't underestimate its simplicity; this game tests your reflexes     |
  |   like no other! And while your ship might become stardust in a         |
  |   matter of seconds, you can instantly jump back in for "just one       |
  |   more go".                                                             |
